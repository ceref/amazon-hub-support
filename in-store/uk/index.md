## How the service works
### Driver Delivery
A driver will arrive at your store to deliver parcels for Amazon customers who choose you as pickup location. When the driver hands you the parcel, you need to scan each parcel label. This will send a customer notification that the parcel is ready for pickup. The customer has 14 days to pickup the parcel.

#### What do I do? Please test the following steps on the Amazon app below:
1. Select “Driver delivery” from the home screen.
1. Scan all parcels by placing each parcel label in the scan frame. Test it by clicking on the scan frame below.
1. You can see the scanned parcel below the camera. Check if all parcels are scanned. If you have done so the task will automatically end by showing ‘Done’. If you have read this, please click on “small box”.
1. Store parcels in a secure and organized place to ensure easy retrieval when the customer arrives.

#### What if I am busy? Please test the following steps on the Amazon app below:
1. Delivered parcels must be scanned in within 30 minutes.
1. If you choose to defer the scan, you will be asked to confirm your choice and be reminded of the 30 minutes time window.
1. Once the 30 minute timer expires, you must scan parcels immediately. Until the parcels are scanned, you will not be able to access other Amazon Hub Counter workflows.

## How to check expected deliveries
#### What is Parcel Inventory?
Inventory refers to the parcels that are in delivery to your store or have been delivered to your store already, but have yet to be picked up by Amazon customers or a delivery driver for parcels that were never picked up within the specified period of time. Parcels in inventory should be stored in a safe and secure area out of sight and reach of customers. Closets, cabinets, and drawers with close proximity to where customers pay are optimal places to house the parcel inventory.
1. Click on the icon on the top left on the menu. 
1. If you click on ‘Inventory’, you can see the current amount of packages in your store
1. Click on ‘Sync’ to update the status of the current packages.
